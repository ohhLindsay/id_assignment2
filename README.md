# Latest COVID-19 Statistics

This is a website that i've created that will allow the viewers to browse through the most latest update of the covid-19 cases all around the world. They will be able to see the "New confirmed cases", "Total confirmed cases", "New deaths", "Total deaths", and the last updated date. There will also be tips on what you should do to prevent covid-19 as well as showing the symptoms of Covid-19 and a few covid-19 resources links.

## Design Process

This website that i've created is mainly to target anyone who wants to view the most latest updated cases of the covid-19 from all the differnt countires. For my design process, i first started planning out a wireframe on how i wanted to layout my website. For the index page also known as the home page, i added the API that i've selected which is the "Covid-19" api from rapidapi website. I designed in a way where there is a dropdown bar for the viewers to look for their countries or just type out their country name to view the latest cases. Also, the navigation bar will navigate the users to different pages on the website. On the "About us" page, i mainly explained what is this website about and also sharing some tips of what things they should do to prevent covid as well as mentioning all the symptoms of the covid-19. Lastly for the "contact us" page, i used a table to display the list of offical covid-19 resource. 
For the colour scheme for the website, i decided to stick to colours like the earth ball so the colours will be like blue, green, white and black.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As an audience to view this website to see the work done by the creator, i would need to use the navigation bar to navigate me to the portfolio page so that i can view the work there.

## Features

At the index page which is the homepage, i splited it into two column so that i can add my picture at one
side and the other side is for me to briefly introduce myself. As for below, i created a manual slideshow where i included some of the work i've done. 
On the Navigation bar, there is a portfolio dropdown that shows Design and Web Development. I splited my portfolio into two html file, one is for design and the other is about web development so i can split it up and include my work in the different page. Lastly, i also created a contact me page, where the audience can contact me if they have any enquiry.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - The manual slideshow that is shown in the index page (homepage) allowed user to briefly look through the work i've done.
- Feature 2 - The navigation bar, allowed the user to easily navigate to the desire page that they want.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
- I would like to create a more interactive website in the furture  to interact more with the audience. This is one of my favourite interactive website : https://simplychocolate.dk/

### Features Left to Implement
- Other than having a more interactive website, i also would like to include feature like an audio slideshow or a simple fast game feature.

As for the "success message appears notice" it also doesn't show on gifthub on all the browser and only shown on the html file.

The different sizing and browser works fine on all the devices and browsers.
