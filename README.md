# Latest COVID-19 Statistics

This is a website that I've created for web user that will allow the viewers to browse through the most recent update of the covid-19 cases all around the world. They will be able to see the "New confirmed cases", "Total confirmed cases", "New deaths", "Total deaths", and the last updated date. There will also be tips on what you should do to prevent covid-19 as well as showing the symptoms of Covid-19 and a few covid-19 resources links.

# Chosen API

Covid-19 API from Rapidapi "https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193"

## Design Process

This website that i've created is mainly to target anyone who wants to view the most latest updated cases of the covid-19 from all the different countries. For my design process, I first started planning out a wireframe on how I wanted to layout my website. For the index page also known as the home page, i added the API that i've selected which is the "Covid-19" api from rapidapi website. I designed in a way where there is a dropdown bar for the viewers to look for their countries or just type out their country name to view the latest cases. Also, the navigation bar will navigate the users to different pages on the website. On the "About us" page, I mainly explained what this website is about and also shared some tips of what things they should do to prevent covid as well as mentioning all the symptoms of the covid-19. Lastly, for the "contact us" page, I used a table to display the list of official covid-19 resources. 
For the colour scheme for the website, i decided to stick to colours like the earth ball so the colours will be blue, green, white and black.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As an audience to view this website to see the work done by the creator, i would be able to view the most latest updated cases of the covid-19 cases in all the different countries, i will be able to do it by looking through the dropdown list or typing down the country name to view the cases for the different countries.

## Features

At the index page which is the homepage, i used a div container to display out the result of the cases ("New confirmed cases", "Total confirmed cases", "New deaths", "Total deaths", and the last updated date). There is also a dropdown menu for the viewers to look through the option of the country to see the result of the covid-19 cases or they can just type out the country name to search for the country.
On the Navigation bar, there is a Homepage, About us page and a contact us page. In the about us page, I mainly explained what this website is about and also gave tips on how to prevent the virus as well as some other resources like the symptoms of the covid and what to do if you are sick. All those resources was taken from : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19#:~:text=symptoms . Lastly, for the contact us page, i used the div container to display a table to list out the official covid-19 resources links. 

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - Dropdown menu for the api, to allow the viewers to briefly look through the country to view the case's result.
- Feature 2 - The navigation bar, allowed the users to easily navigate to the desired page that they want.
- Feature 3 - Table list, to display the list of the official covid-19 resources.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
- I would like to create an interactive website by adding in a real-time covid-19 map for the viewer to look through around the map and allowing them to view the list of the affected country. Also, allowing the viewers to look back to another date to check the result.

### Features Left to Implement
- Other than having a more interactive website, I also would like to include features like a short quiz game about the covid-19 which can help the viewers to better understand about the virus and a real-time list of the covid cases.
